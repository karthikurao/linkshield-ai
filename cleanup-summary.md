# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Initial State
- Repository Size: ~3GB
- Main space consumers:
  - `backend/venv`: ~1.5GB
  - `frontend/node_modules`: ~166MB
  - `ml_training/dataset/clean_urls.csv`: ~43MB

## Actions Taken

1. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added comprehensive patterns to exclude development artifacts
   - Explicitly excluded virtual environments and node_modules
   - Added patterns for large data files and build artifacts

2. **Cleaned Large Directories**
   - Removed Python virtual environment (backend/venv)
   - Removed node_modules directory (frontend/node_modules)
   - Created sample of large ML dataset and backed up the original

3. **Added Documentation**
   - Created SETUP.md with detailed setup instructions
   - Created repository_maintenance.md with best practices
   - Updated README.md with repository maintenance information
   - Created .env.example files for both backend and frontend

4. **Setup Environment Templates**
   - Added example environment files for reproducible setup
   - Documented AWS free tier service usage

## Current State
- Repository Size: ~160MB (reduced by ~95%)
- Main remaining components:
  - `frontend`: ~65MB
  - `backend`: ~48MB
  - `ml_training`: ~43MB (mostly due to backup file)

## Next Steps for GitHub Upload

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clean repository for GitHub upload"
   ```

2. **Create a new GitHub repository**:
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository
   - Follow the instructions to push an existing repository

3. **Push the repository**:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/linkshield-ai.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

4. **Consider Git LFS** for any remaining large files:
   - If you need to track ML models or other large files
   - Follow instructions in docs/repository_maintenance.md

## Maintaining the Repository

- Never commit virtual environments or node_modules
- Use requirements.txt and package.json for dependencies
- Store large datasets externally when possible
- Follow the guidelines in docs/repository_maintenance.md
