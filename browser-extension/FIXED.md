# ✅ Browser Extension Authentication Fixed!

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The **401 Unauthorized errors** have been completely resolved! Your browser extension now works seamlessly without requiring user authentication.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

1. **Added Guest Access Function**: Created `get_current_user_sub_optional()` that returns `None` instead of throwing errors for unauthenticated requests

2. **Updated API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/v1/predict/` - Now accepts requests without authentication ✅
   - `/api/v1/analyze-url/` - Now works for guest users ✅
   - History/Profile endpoints still require auth (as intended) 🔒

3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Authenticated users still get full functionality with scan history

## 🧪 **Verification Steps**

### Test 1: API Without Authentication
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predict/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://google.com"}'
```
**Expected**: `200 OK` with scan results ✅

### Test 2: Browser Extension
1. **Load extension** in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. **Visit any website** - should see immediate scanning in console
3. **Check extension badge** - should show ✓ for safe sites
4. **No 401 errors** in DevTools console

### Test 3: Real-Time Scanning
1. **Open DevTools** (F12) → Console
2. **Navigate to different sites**
3. **Look for logs**:
   ```
   LinkShield: Scanning URL before navigation: https://example.com
   LinkShield: API response: {status: "safe", confidence: 0.95}
   ✅ No 401 errors!
   ```

## 🛡️ **Current Status**

**✅ Working**: Browser extension real-time scanning
**✅ Working**: Guest user URL analysis
