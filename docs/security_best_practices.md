# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the LinkShield AI application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation

- **Token Structure**: Each JWT contains a payload with user ID, expiration time, and role
- **Secret Management**: JWT secrets are stored in AWS Parameter Store as SecureStrings
- **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 60 minutes of inactivity
- **Refresh Mechanism**: Secure token refresh flow to prevent session hijacking

### Password Management

- **Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factor (12+)
- **No Password Storage**: Only password hashes are stored, never plain text
- **Password Requirements**:
  - Minimum 10 characters
  - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Not among commonly used passwords
  - Not matching user's personal information

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- **TOTP Implementation**: Time-based One-Time Password for premium users
- **App Integration**: Compatible with standard authenticator apps
- **Recovery Options**: Secure recovery process with backup codes

## Data Protection

### Data-at-Rest

- **Database Encryption**: RDS instances use AWS KMS for encryption
- **S3 Encryption**: All objects in S3 buckets are encrypted using SSE-S3
- **Backup Encryption**: All backups are encrypted with unique keys

### Data-in-Transit

- **TLS Enforcement**: All API communications use TLS 1.3
- **HTTPS Only**: Frontend forces HTTPS connections
- **HSTS Implementation**: HTTP Strict Transport Security headers

### Data Minimization

- **Need-to-Know Basis**: User data collected only as needed for functionality
- **Regular Cleanup**: Automatic purging of stale data
- **Anonymization**: Statistical data is anonymized before storage

## API Security

### Input Validation

- **Schema Validation**: All API inputs validated against strict schemas
- **Data Sanitization**: Input data sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints protected against abuse with rate limiting

### CORS Configuration

- **Restricted Origins**: CORS configured with specific allowed origins
- **Credentials Handling**: Careful management of credentials in cross-origin requests
- **Headers Control**: Only necessary headers exposed in CORS responses

### API Authentication

- **Token Verification**: All API requests authenticated via JWT
- **Role-Based Access**: Endpoints restricted based on user roles
- **Audit Logging**: All authentication attempts logged for audit

## Frontend Security

### Content Security Policy

- **CSP Headers**: Strict Content Security Policy to prevent XSS attacks
- **Inline Scripts**: No inline scripts used in the application
- **External Resources**: Only approved external resources allowed

### Local Storage Usage

- **Sensitive Data**: No sensitive data stored in local/session storage
- **Token Storage**: Tokens stored with appropriate expiration and secure flags

### XSS Prevention

- **React Security**: Leveraging React's built-in XSS protections
- **Output Encoding**: All dynamic content properly encoded before rendering
- **User Content**: User-generated content sanitized before display

## Infrastructure Security

### AWS Security

- **IAM Best Practices**:
  - Least privilege principle
  - Role-based access
  - No hardcoded credentials
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive inbound/outbound rules
- **Network Isolation**: Resources in private subnets where possible

### CI/CD Security

- **Secret Management**: Secrets managed via GitHub Secrets
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies
- **Image Scanning**: Container images scanned for vulnerabilities

### Monitoring & Alerting

- **CloudWatch Alarms**: Alerts for suspicious activities
- **Login Monitoring**: Failed login attempts tracked and alerted
- **API Abuse Detection**: Alerts for unusual API usage patterns

## Incident Response

### Breach Protocol

1. **Detection**: Monitoring systems for unauthorized access
2. **Containment**: Procedures for limiting breach impact
3. **Eradication**: Removing unauthorized access and fixing vulnerabilities
4. **Recovery**: Restoring systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident analysis and improvement

### Vulnerability Management

- **Regular Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Patching Policy**: Critical patches applied within 24 hours
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of all dependencies

### Reporting

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Clear policy for vulnerability reporting
- **Bug Bounty**: Acknowledgment for responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities
- **Transparency**: Communication plan for security incidents

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection measures aligned with GDPR requirements
- **CCPA Readiness**: Features supporting California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOC 2**: Controls aligned with SOC 2 principles

## Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing by external parties
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews for all changes
- **SAST/DAST**: Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing in the CI/CD pipeline
