# LinkShield AI - System Architecture

## Overview
LinkShield AI is an advanced security solution that leverages machine learning to detect and prevent phishing attacks. The system analyzes URLs and web content to identify potential threats, providing users with real-time protection while browsing the web.

## System Components

### 1. Frontend (React.js)
- **User Interface**: Interactive web application built with React
- **Features**:
  - URL scanning interface
  - Scan history visualization
  - User authentication and profile management
  - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
  - Dark/Light theme support

### 2. Backend (FastAPI)
- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints for client communication
- **Core Services**:
  - URL processing and sanitization
  - ML model inference
  - User authentication and authorization
  - History tracking and management

### 3. Machine Learning Component
- **Model**: Fine-tuned BERT-based model for phishing URL detection
- **Training Pipeline**: Custom training pipeline with dataset preparation
- **Features Extraction**: NLP techniques for URL and content analysis

### 4. Deployment Architecture
- **Serverless Architecture**: AWS Lambda for backend services
- **Frontend Hosting**: Static site hosting (AWS S3/CloudFront)
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment

## Data Flow
1. User submits URL through frontend interface
2. Backend API validates and preprocesses the URL
3. ML model analyzes the URL and extracts features
4. Model provides prediction (phishing probability)
5. Result is returned to frontend and displayed to user
6. Scan is recorded in user history (if authenticated)

## Security Considerations
- Secure API authentication with JWT
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## Performance Optimizations
- Model quantization for faster inference
- Caching mechanism for frequently scanned URLs
- Lazy loading of frontend components

## Future Enhancements
- Browser extension integration
- Real-time website scanning
- Advanced reporting and analytics dashboard
- Threat intelligence integration
