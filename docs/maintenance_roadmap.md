- Model inference speed (target: <100ms)
- Frontend load time (target: <1.5s)
- Database query performance (target: <50ms)

### Business Metrics
- Active users (daily/monthly)
- URLs scanned per day
- Detection accuracy
- User retention rate
- Conversion rate (free to premium)

### Infrastructure Metrics
- Server uptime (target: 99.9%)
- CPU/memory utilization
- Network throughput
- Error rates
- Database connection pool usage

## Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling
- Lambda function concurrency adjustments
- Auto-scaling for container-based services
- Database read replica implementation

- Caching layer implementation
- Resource allocation based on usage patterns

## Retirement Strategy

For features or components that need to be retired:

1. Announce deprecation with timeline (minimum 3 months notice)
2. Provide migration path for affected users
3. Implement graceful degradation during transition
4. Maintain backward compatibility where possible
5. Archive relevant documentation for future reference
